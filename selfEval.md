# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0,
  and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught.
  How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

  - I'm feeling confident and excited to start Mod 1.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

  - I need to be more disciplined about taking breaks while working. Maybe I will try using a timer.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

  - I'll make a solid effort to keep my syntax and formatting consistent.
